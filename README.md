                             EMOTION CLASSIFICATION USING ML
                             
The analysis of the emotions of sentences by using Machine Learning. We use Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the analysis of emotion in the sentence or text. This project comes under Emotion Detection (ED), this is a branch of Sentiment Analysis which deals with the extraction and analysis of emotions.Emotion models are the foundations of ED systems; they define how emotions are represented. The models assume that emotions exist in various states thus the need to distinguish between the various emotional states.The emotions that prompt individuals to pen down certain words at particular times are what text-based ED is concerned about. In this project we train the machine with some datasets, the datasets will have sentences with the emotions given. After training the machine with the datasets, the machine can analyze the sentence or text and return the emotion of the sentence.


  MOTIVATION:
  
The Emotion Classification is a branch of Sentiment and Emotion Analysis. This is used to find the emotion/sentiment of text or sentence. This aims to comprehensively guide novices in the field of text-based ED. thus this article presents major-related concepts, detection approaches, and emotion-labelled data sources available for undertaking text-based ED operations. It also discusses the state-of-the-art, their results, and their limitations. Through the review of recent literature from 2015 to 2020, the direction of research in this field and essential opportunities for improving the detection of emotions from texts to encourage research in the field are unveiled.


PROBLEM STATEMENT:

An emotion/sentiment should be given from a sentence. To get an emotion of a sentence, we first need to understand/know about the emotions of some sentences. A person may take many hours to read and understand many sentences. An easier method should be available to detect the emotion from a sentence.


SOLUTION:

We must create a machine learning model for reading and understanding the sentences. The machine will read and understand thousands of sentences within seconds or minutes.
This model is first trained by reading and learning analyze how the sentences are written and what is the emotion of that sentence, then this model is tested by reading the sentences and checking whether the emotion of the sentence is correct, after this the model totally ready. Now by giving a sentence we can get the emotion of the sentence almost accurately.
